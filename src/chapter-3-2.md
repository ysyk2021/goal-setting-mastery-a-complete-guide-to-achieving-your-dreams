In order to achieve our dreams and aspirations, it is crucial to set meaningful goals that align with our values and vision for the future. However, we often encounter limiting beliefs that can hinder our progress and prevent us from reaching our full potential. In this chapter, we will explore common limiting beliefs about goal setting and strategies to overcome them.

**Understanding Limiting Beliefs**
----------------------------------

Limiting beliefs are deeply ingrained thoughts or perceptions that hold us back from pursuing our goals. They are often formed as a result of past experiences, societal expectations, or self-doubt. Common limiting beliefs related to goal setting include:

1. **"I'm not capable":** This belief stems from a lack of confidence in one's abilities. It can manifest as self-doubt and a fear of failure.

2. **"It's too late":** This belief suggests that achieving meaningful goals is only possible at a certain age or stage in life. It can limit us from pursuing new opportunities or taking risks.

3. **"I don't deserve it":** This belief reflects a sense of unworthiness or low self-esteem. It can prevent us from setting ambitious goals and striving for success.

4. **"I don't have enough resources":** This belief centers around a perceived lack of resources, such as time, money, or support. It can create a sense of helplessness and discourage us from even trying.
